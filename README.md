# ztop

An attempt to create an htop-like CPU Program Limiter. This is a basic way to not have my fans go crazy when I only have Safari open. I'm looking at you [Bird](https://github.com/martnst/OS-X-Process-Cheatsheet)!

Example:

Safari CPU: 70%

could be limited to 25% max

Safari CPU: 25% (70%)
